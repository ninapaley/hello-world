# hello-world
my first repository
My name is Nina Paley. I'm an artist and animator. I've heard about github for years, but never made an account. My coding knowledge extends to a hazy fragmented memory of high school BASIC ("goto"! subroutines! "print"!) and some very rudimentary html ("href"!). I am HIGHLY MOTIVATED to collaborate with toolness on our Mystic Symbolic art generator, so it's time for me to learn some stuff.
